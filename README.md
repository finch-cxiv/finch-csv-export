# finch-csv-export

[the Finch API](https://tryfinch.com/) provides access to over 190 HRIS and payroll systems and returns data in a JSON format - a common business format for data analysis is a [flat CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) that teams can read in excel

this application transforms Finch JSON data into a flat CSV that can be exported and opened in Excel, Google Sheets etc.

when configured with an access token, this application will export [pay-statements](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/reference/d5fd02c41e83a-pay-statement) dated with a start_date and an end_date

[pay-statements](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/reference/d5fd02c41e83a-pay-statement) are flattened to the pay-statement-line-level (that is some unique combination of individual_id + payment_id) and enhanced with [payment](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/reference/b811fdc2542ca-payment) date (for payment dates) and [directory](https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/reference/12419c085fc0e-directory) data (for individual names)
